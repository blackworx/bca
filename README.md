# bca
BCA (.bca, Binary Chroma Animation) is a file format for time/frame based animations for Razer Chroma enabled devices.

A .bca file contains data for each frame wrapped in a package containing 
+ a frame header
+ a device header for each device in this frame
+ color data with row/column asignment for the specific device

See Wiki for more information and a detailed file structure.

For reading and playing these animations there is a C# project which uses [Colore](https://github.com/CoraleStudios/Colore).
